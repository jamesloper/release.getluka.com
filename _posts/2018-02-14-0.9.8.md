### Improvements
- We've given the member's list a fresh lick of paint. Now, it's easier to see who's in your area and which locals they've shared. See the image below for an example!
- Receipts also received some attention: we've updated the icons and made links easier to see. See below for an example.
- Added dozens of new Amplitude tracking events, allowing product marketing to have better insight into behavior funnels.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue causing the app to slow down when users try to view extremely large black books. Instead of trying to load hundreds at a time, it will load lower results as you scroll. Check out Alfredo's profile to see this in action.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the app from taking you to the correct feature after tapping an iOS or Android notification.
- Fixed 14 additional and less interesting bugs

### Delayed
- Facebook installation tracking had to be cut from this release. Originally, we thought this would be a quick project as Expo supported Facebook's App Ads SDK. That assumption, however, was incorrect, as we conflated App Ads with their Audience platform. This project has been pushed to the top of our backlog.
